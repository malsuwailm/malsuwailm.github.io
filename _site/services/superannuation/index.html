<h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>

<p>Histogram representing the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases, commonly known as the GC content, in each bin of the chromosome, excluding bins that contain ‘N’ nucleotides. It plots the number of bins against their respective GC percentages. The x-axis represents the GC content percentage, while the y-axis shows the number of bins with that specific GC content.</p>

<p>The findings from chromosome 22 are then extrapolated to the entire human genome. The total genome size, computed in an earlier part of the project, serves as the basis for this extrapolation. By applying the proportion of poorly sequenced bases in chromosome 22 to the entire genome size, an estimate is made of the total number of bases in the human genome that could be sequenced poorly.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6y0yLHV/Screenshot-from-2024-01-21-01-45-05.png" alt="data2" /></p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The project’s comprehensive analysis began with the assessment of genomic data from eight different species, revealing a broad spectrum of genomic sizes and complexities. The data unveiled that the genome sizes ranged from as small as approximately 4.64 Mbp in E. coli to as vast as approximately 14.55 Gbp in wheat, illustrating the wide genetic diversity across species. Chromosome counts varied, with E. coli having a single circular chromosome, while humans (hg38) possess 24 distinct chromosomes. The largest chromosome identified was chromosome 1 in humans, spanning over 248 Mbp, whereas the smallest was the mitochondrial chromosome in yeast, underlining the vast differences in chromosome sizes and their potential functional implications.</p>

<p>The sequencing coverage simulations provided further insights. The histogram outputs from the 5x and 15x coverage simulations showed a skewed distribution of coverage, with a significant number of sequences falling below the expected average coverage, indicating potential sequencing gaps. The discrepancy from Poisson expectations suggested the presence of a bias in sequencing, which might be attributed to various biological factors such as GC content, which can affect the efficiency of sequencing.</p>

<p>The nucleotide composition analysis of chromosome 22 demonstrated a prevalence of adenine and thymine over cytosine and guanine, while a considerable amount of the chromosome comprised unidentified nucleotides (Ns). This was further quantified by the window analysis, where bins were analyzed for the presence of ‘N’s, and nearly 116,637 bins were found to contain at least one ‘N’. The GC content histogram revealed a normal distribution, with a notable number of bins having extremely low or high GC content, which correlates with regions known to be difficult to sequence, hence likely to be sequenced poorly.</p>

<p>The visual data from the histograms indicated a significant portion of the genome with extreme GC content, which is known to pose challenges in sequencing due to secondary structures and polymerase bias. These results, extrapolated to the entire human genome, suggest that around 700,250 bins without any ‘N’s are expected to sequence poorly, further asserting the importance of understanding genomic composition for sequencing efforts.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The findings from the comparative genomic analysis underscore the intricate diversity in genetic composition among species. The project highlighted the crucial interplay between genome size, chromosome structure, and nucleotide composition and their collective impact on sequencing. The histograms and statistical analyses provided a tangible representation of the sequencing coverage and nucleotide distribution, offering a microcosmic view of the genomic landscape. The study concluded that while technological advancements have significantly improved sequencing capabilities, challenges remain, especially in regions with high or low GC content, and in accurately representing repetitive sequences and regions with unidentified nucleotides. These insights not only contribute to the field of genomics but also enhance the understanding of genomic data’s complexity, paving the way for improved sequencing techniques and more accurate genomic assemblies. The project stands as a testament to the pivotal role of data science in translating raw genomic data into actionable genomic knowledge.</p>
